### Specific Section of the Source (e.g., start/end time for videos or page numbers for books)

Second problem 

### Summary/Synopsis

Determining diffrent possible routes for going from one point to another through different ways. It combines graph theory, algorithm design, and optimization to solve real-world routing challenges.

### Main Idea

In the figure below, only downward movements (moving from your current position to the position directly below) are allowed. Determine the total number of possible paths from point A to point B.

### FAQ

Here are five **FAQ** related to the problem of determining the total number of possible paths from point A to point B with only downward movements allowed:

### 1. **Q:** What are the rules for moving between points in this figure?
   **A:** In this problem, you can only move downward, meaning you can travel from a higher point to a directly connected lower point, but not upward or sideways.

### 2. **Q:** How do I calculate the total number of possible paths from point A to point B?
   **A:** To calculate the total number of paths, you need to count all possible ways you can move downward from point A to point B, considering each branch where a choice can be made.

### 3. **Q:** Can I move diagonally or horizontally in any part of the figure?
   **A:** No, only vertical downward movements are allowed in this scenario. Movements to the side or upward are not permitted.

### 4. **Q:** What if I encounter an obstacle while moving downward?
   **A:** This problem does not include obstacles, so all downward paths from point A to point B are available. You only need to determine how many different ways exist to travel downward.

### 5. **Q:** Is there a formula to solve problems like this, where only downward movements are allowed?
   **A:** While there is no single formula for every case, you can use combinatorics and systematic counting methods like recursion or dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible paths, depending on the structure of the figure.

These FAQs provide clarity on the problem's rules and strategies for finding the solution.
