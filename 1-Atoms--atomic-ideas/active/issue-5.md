## Idea Content

### Idea Title

Graph-Based Approaches for Efficient Multi-Stop Journeys and Symmetry in Path Selection

### Relevant/Source Link (video, book, etc.)

365 math problems for 365 days, https://ketab.ir/book/668b8259-1e34-4e06-a556-331e61edd26f

### Specific Section of the Source (e.g., start/end time for videos or page numbers for books)

Second problem 

### Summary/Synopsis

Determining diffrent possible routes for going from one point to another through different ways. It combines graph theory, algorithm design, and optimization to solve real-world routing challenges.
