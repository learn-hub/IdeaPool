We are focused on gathering atomic ideas for now. The other folders are:\n\n1-Atoms--atomic-ideas\n2-Molecules--linked-concepts\n3-Macromolecules--single-lesson\n4-Organs--full-module\n5-Organisms--full-course\n\nRFC-Inspired Process\nOur process is modeled after the RFC approach, using clearly defined stages for each level of content:\n/atomic-ideas\n├── 0000-template.md      # Template for proposing new ideas\n├── README.md             # Overview and guidelines for the idea submission process\n├── accepted/             # Folder for accepted ideas\n│   ├── 0001-example.md   # Example of an accepted idea\n│   ├── 0002-another.md   # Another accepted idea\n│   └── ...\n├── rejected/             # Folder for rejected ideas\n│   ├── 0001-rejected.md  # Example of a rejected idea\n│   └── ...\n├── withdrawn/            # Folder for withdrawn ideas\n│   ├── 0001-withdrawn.md # Example of a withdrawn idea\n│   └── ...\n└── active/               # Folder for ideas currently under discussion\n    ├── 0001-active.md    # Example of an idea under discussion\n    └── ...\n\nThe process starts with submitting an issue using a predefined template. If it passes a minimum check, it will be marked as \"accepted-candidate,\" and a new markdown file will automatically be created under the \"active\" folder for further discussion and work.\n\nYou are given a text that is in markdown format which belongs to the IdeaPool repository on GitHub. These articles may contain mixed Farsi and English language terms. First, translate the article to English. Don'\''t change the header/titles and don'\''t change the format for idea type, category, and subcategories. If any field didn'\''t have any response, try to provide some information for that field. Also, improve the title of the idea or any other field. The goal is to have this article consumable for educators and educational content creators. For the Frequently Asked Questions field, give five FAQs related to the idea. For Experiential Scenarios, imagine you are a teacher and you want to put your student in a hypothetical or real challenge. Describe five examples of challenges students can face, and how they can use the concepts in this topic to overcome them. At the end of it, add the full translation of the updated text in farsi. The response should not have any escaped charchters like \n. The response should be unscaped string. Describe five examples of challenges students can face and how they can use the concepts in this topic to overcome them. At the end of the response, provide the full translation of the updated text in Farsi. The response should not include any escaped characters such as \n and should be an unescaped string. Additionally, if there are any images in the text, include a descriptive alt text after each one. If the text comes from a book or an article, include the source text after it. On top of the file add the tags for main education topic, idea type, main context topic and the general score in latex format something like this (fix the latex commands for color space and textbf): **Tags:** $${ '\c'olor{purple}[Logarithmic] '\s'pace { '\c'olor{black},} '\s'pace '\c'olor{green}[Application] '\s'pace { '\c'olor{black},} '\c'olor{olive}[Earthquake] '\s'pace { '\c'olor{black},} '\s'pace { '\c'olor{salmon} '\t'extbf{8/10}}}$$ "},
